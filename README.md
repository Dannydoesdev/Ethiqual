# AgilEthical

The high level problems I want to solve for:
- Not all ‘ethical’ companies are great employers
- People looking for ethical jobs might not utilise tools like glassdoor, or glassdoor won’t have the smaller companies listed
- The ethical community and knowledge is fairly tight knit on whats good/bad to work for

A community/job board site for ethical jobs, reviews, discussion and info about ethical companies as employers
